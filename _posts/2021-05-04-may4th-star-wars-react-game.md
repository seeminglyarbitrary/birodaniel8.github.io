Hello there! Happy May 4th to every Star Wars fan!

Given that today is the official Star Wars day and I am a serious geek on Star Wars, this year I wanted to do something fun for this day of the year.
Currently, I have been exploring the realms of web development and I thought this might be a good opportunity to create something fun with React.

You might be familiar with the six degrees of separation theory (if not, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcxZSmzPw8k){:target="_blank"} from one of my favorite youtube channels), 
that has been used to come up with a game where you are dropped randomly at a Wikipedia page and you should be able to get to Adolf Hitler in 5 steps using available links (just to make the game a bit morbid).
Recently I have come across a Star Wars API and I just knew that I want to use it for something in the future so here it goes:

[Star Wars Character Search Game](https://birodaniel8.github.io/react-to-github-pages/){:target="_blank"}

At this point, the game itself does not look good at all and there are still functionalities missing, but I did want to share this on May4th and it is already playable.
The basic idea is that if you start a game then it will randomly choose a target and initial character and just by clicking on attributes of the presented cards you should get to the target character.
Some of the cards will tell you more about the selected item (e.g. planets will show you some additional info regarding that planet) while other attributes will list items with the same characteristic.
To make the game a bit harder, every item can only show 5 related items (the movie card will not show you all the characters in that movie).

I will continue to work on this little game and give an update once it is finished. Have fun!
