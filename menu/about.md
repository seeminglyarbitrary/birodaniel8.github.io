I am Daniel Biro from Budapest, Hungary and this SeeminglyArbitrary, my little brainchild to share some geeky fun stuff I am spending my time with ocasionally. The purpose of this site is not to share any Earth-shaking ideas but just to document small things I have been enjoyed learning and maybe these can also be useful to someone else who reads some of my posts.

About me, I have studied maths and finance at the university here at the beautiful city of [Budapest](https://www.onhisowntrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zBudapest-Ticketbar.jpg) and I am currently working at finance but I have always enjoyed coding and all the fun that comes with it. In my free time I am a huge Star Wars and The Office fan but I also play the [piano](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCclTjzrxjniVXxce4aD8P1A) and the accordion.

Enjoy!
